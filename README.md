# Insurance Voice Agent

This repository contains a simple browser-based voice assistant that collects auto insurance information using OpenAI's GPT model.

## Running

Open the `public/index.html` file in your browser. Provide your OpenAI API key, allow microphone access, and click **Start Recording** to begin the conversation. The assistant will speak and listen to gather details, displaying the collected data as JSON on the page.

No backend server is required; all requests are sent directly from the browser to OpenAI.
